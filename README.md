# Kinect
## Installation / Setup
1. Clone project  
   Install at the directory of choice with the following cmd command:  
   
   `git clone https://github.com/UWB-ARSandbox/Kinect.git --recursive`  
   
   Be sure to include the `--recursive` command, as this will also clone the submodules (including the very important 'Networking' module!)

2. Open Project  
   Open Unity and select 'Open'. Select the folder git just created for you (eg. "Documents/Kinect"). Unity will automatically generate any files that aren't synced with the project, such as the Library directory. 

3. Open Scene  
   By default, after cloning the project there will be no scene open. Find the appropriate scene and open it via the Unity editor Project View.

WARNING: This does not currently have proper prefabs to handle motion of hands/head
